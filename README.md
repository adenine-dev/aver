# Aver
A dead simple logging library for rust. Currently supports colors, logging levels, and a simpler syntax. This library requires no dependencies (except for winapi if you are using windows sorry.)

## Installation
simply add this to your Cargo.toml
```
aver = "0.1.3"
```

## Usage
You can just start using aver in your project by including it with `extern crate aver`. Then using one of its commands.
```rust
log_trace!("this is a trace method, it is disabled by default (see below)");
log_debug!("same as above!");
log_info!("any of these can take ", "any ", "number of arguments");
log_warn!("can they be of any type? ", true);
log_error!("An error");
log_fatal!("Even worse than ana error!");
```

### Log levels
Aver comes with 8 logging levels: `All`, `Trace`, `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, `Fatal`, `Off`. In order of increasing precedence. You can set the log level with `aver::set_log_level(LogLevel)`, by default aver uses `Info` meaning that trace and debug will be disabled.

### Colors
Using colors is as simple as:
```rust
log_info!(aver::colors::blue(), "this will be shown in blue!", aver::colors::reset(), " and this won't");
log_info!(aver::colors::on_blue(), "this will be shown on blue!", aver::colors::reset(), " and this won't");
```
Currently `white`, `grey`, `red`, `yellow`, `green`, `cyan`, `blue`, and `magenta` are supported for text color, and `on_white`, `on_grey`, `on_red`, `on_yellow`, `on_green`, `on_cyan`, `on_blue`, and `on_magenta` are supported for background colors. Linux systems are untested however should workâ„¢.
